# Design-of-basic-16-bit--ALU-with-7-opcode-Functions-using-verilog
This project involves designing a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog, capable of performing seven different operations based on a 3-bit opcode.  The ALU will take two 16-bit inputs (A and B) and the 3-bit opcode as input, and produce a 16-bit output (Result).
